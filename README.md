Adaptive Priority Queue (Java)

A Java implementation of an Adaptive Priority Queue (APQ) using a min-heap and a HashMap to support efficient priority updates, insertions, and deletions — optimized for applications like Dijkstra’s algorithm and task scheduling.

⸻

Features
	•	Min-Heap Based: Maintains ordering by priority with O(log n) insert and remove operations.
	•	HashMap Lookup: Enables O(1) access to check element existence or update priorities.
	•	Adaptive Priority Handling: Dynamically updates element positions on priority change.
	•	Stable Implementation: Supports duplicate priorities and maintains consistency during heap operations.
